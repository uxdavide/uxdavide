<h1 align="left">👋🏻 Hey, I'm @uxdavide</h1>

**UX/UI Designer** for SaaS that converts users, not just impresses them.

<h2 align="left">🚀 What makes me different</h2>

I'm an ex-developer who understands both sides of the equation. While most designers focus on making things pretty, I focus on making things work. Every pixel serves a purpose, every interaction drives a result.

<h2 align="left">🛠️ How I help SaaS founders</h2>

- **Product Redesign** → Transform confusing interfaces into conversion machines
- **Foundation Builder** → Build MVP interfaces on solid data, not shaky assumptions  
- **Growth Sprint** → Identify and fix specific UX bottlenecks killing your conversions
- **Web Design** → Landing pages that turn visitors into customers

<h2 align="left">🎯 My approach</h2>

**Data-driven decisions** - Real user feedback beats personal opinions  
**Technical understanding** - I know what's feasible and what's just wishful thinking  
**Business mindset** - Every design choice connects to your bottom line
